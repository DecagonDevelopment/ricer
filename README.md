# Tom's GNU/Linux Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles! The name of the repo, "voidrice", came from the fact they were originally on my Void Linux machine, but these files are distro-independent. In fact, I now push changes from my X200 running Parabola or my X220 running Arch.

## Dynamic Configuration Files

Store your favorite or high-traffic directories in `~/.config/bmdirs` or your most
important config files in `~/.config/bmfiles` with keyboard shortcuts. When you add
things to theses files my vimrc will automatically run `shortcuts` which will
dynamically generate shortcuts for these in bash, ranger and optionally
qutebrowser and fish.

# "Dependencies" and programs used

The programs I use here are always changing, but luckily you can just look at the installation list for [TARBS](http://decadev.co.uk/TARBS) here:

`A` marks programs in the AUR, `G` marks git repositories.
